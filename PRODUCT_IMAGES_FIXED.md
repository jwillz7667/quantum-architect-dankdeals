# Product Images Fix - Applied Successfully

## Issue Summary

Product images were not loading correctly in the application due to a database update issue caused by Row Level Security (RLS) policies creating an infinite recursion.

## Root Cause

The admin RLS policies in the database had a circular reference:

- To check if a user can access products, it queries the profiles table
- To query profiles, it needs to check if the user has access to profiles
- This created an infinite recursion error: `infinite recursion detected in policy for relation "profiles"`

## Solution Applied

### 1. Used Service Role Key

Created `scripts/fix-product-images-direct.js` that uses the Supabase service role key to bypass RLS entirely:

```javascript
const supabase = createClient(
  process.env.VITE_SUPABASE_URL,
  process.env.VITE_SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY,
  {
    auth: {
      autoRefreshToken: false,
      persistSession: false,
    },
  }
);
```

### 2. Updated All Product Images

Successfully updated all products to use WebP images:

- ✅ Pineapple Fruz - `/assets/products/pineapple-fruz/pineapple-fruz-1.webp`
- ✅ Rainbow Sherbert #11 - `/assets/products/rs11/rainbow-sherbert11-1.webp`
- ✅ Runtz - `/assets/products/runtz/runtz-1.webp`
- ✅ Wedding Cake - `/assets/products/wedding-cake/wedding-cake-1.webp`

### 3. Verified File Existence

All WebP images are present in the public directory:

```
public/assets/products/
├── pineapple-fruz/
│   ├── pineapple-fruz-1.webp
│   ├── pineapple-fruz-2.webp
│   └── pineapple-fruz-3.webp
├── rs11/
│   ├── rainbow-sherbert11-1.webp
│   └── rainbow-sherbert11-2.webp
├── runtz/
│   ├── runtz-1.webp
│   ├── runtz-2.webp
│   └── runtz-3.webp
└── wedding-cake/
    ├── wedding-cake-1.webp
    ├── wedding-cake-2.webp
    └── wedding-cake-3.webp
```

## How the Application Loads Images

1. **Product Mapping**: `src/lib/productImages.ts` contains the `productImageMap` that maps product IDs to their WebP images
2. **Components**: ProductCard and ProductDetail use the `getProductImages()` function to get the correct images
3. **Responsive Loading**: The `ResponsiveImage` component handles lazy loading and WebP format with fallbacks

## Future Considerations

### Fix RLS Policies

The admin policies should be rewritten to avoid circular references. Consider:

```sql
-- Instead of subquery in policies
CREATE POLICY "Admins can do everything with products" ON products
  FOR ALL
  USING (
    EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 FROM auth.users
      WHERE auth.uid() = id
      AND raw_app_meta_data->>'is_admin' = 'true'
    )
  );
```

### Running the Fix Script

If images need to be updated again:

```bash
node scripts/fix-product-images-direct.js
```

## Verification

Images are now loading correctly:

- ✅ Database has correct WebP URLs
- ✅ Files exist in public directory
- ✅ Application components properly configured
- ✅ Development server running on http://localhost:8080
