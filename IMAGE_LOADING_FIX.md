# Image Loading Fix - Best Practices Implementation

## What Was Wrong

1. Overcomplicated `ResponsiveImage` component with too many features
2. No proper fallback mechanism
3. WebP-only images with no JPEG fallbacks
4. Complex lazy loading that wasn't working reliably

## What I Fixed

### 1. Created SimpleImage Component (`src/components/SimpleImage.tsx`)

- **Simple `<img>` tag** - no overcomplicated picture elements
- **Automatic fallback** - tries `.jpg` if `.webp` fails
- **Loading state** - shows placeholder while loading
- **Error handling** - gracefully handles missing images

### 2. Updated Product Components

- `ProductCard.tsx` - now uses SimpleImage
- `ProductDetail.tsx` - now uses SimpleImage
- `HeroSection.tsx` - now uses SimpleImage

### 3. Added Placeholder Image

- Created `/public/assets/placeholder.svg` as ultimate fallback
- Shows "Image Not Available" text when all else fails

### 4. Simplified productImages.ts

- Removed complex category fallbacks
- Added simple placeholder fallback
- Kept the core product mappings intact

## Best Practices Applied

1. **KISS Principle** - Keep It Simple, Stupid
   - Simple img tag > complex picture element
   - Basic error handling > complex lazy loading

2. **Progressive Enhancement**
   - Try WebP first (modern format)
   - Fall back to JPEG automatically
   - Show placeholder if all fails

3. **User Experience**
   - Always show something (never blank)
   - Loading state for feedback
   - Graceful degradation

4. **Performance**
   - Images load immediately (no complex observer)
   - WebP for modern browsers
   - Minimal JavaScript overhead

## How It Works Now

```tsx
<SimpleImage
  src="/assets/products/runtz/runtz-1.webp"
  alt="Runtz Cannabis"
  className="w-full h-full object-cover"
  fallback="/custom-fallback.jpg" // optional
/>
```

1. Tries to load the WebP image
2. If that fails, tries the same path with `.jpg`
3. If custom fallback provided, uses that
4. Shows loading state while loading
5. Always displays something to the user

## Result

- ✅ Images load reliably
- ✅ Fallbacks work automatically
- ✅ Simple, maintainable code
- ✅ Better user experience
