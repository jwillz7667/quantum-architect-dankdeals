# Product Images Production Fix

## Issue Summary

Product images were not loading on the main page, category page, and product detail pages in production, but were working correctly in the cart and checkout pages.

## Root Cause

1. **Lazy Loading Issue**: The `OptimizedImage` component uses IntersectionObserver for lazy loading, which wasn't working reliably in production
2. **Different Image Components**: Cart and checkout pages use regular `<img>` tags that load immediately, while product cards use the OptimizedImage component

## Solution Applied

### 1. Improved OptimizedImage Component

Enhanced the lazy loading implementation with:

- Browser compatibility check for IntersectionObserver
- Fallback mechanism that forces image load after 2 seconds
- Better error handling and logging
- Immediate loading for priority images

### 2. ProductCard Changes

- Set `priority={true}` and `loading="eager"` for product card images
- This ensures images load immediately without waiting for lazy loading

### 3. Database Image URLs

Created `scripts/fix-production-images.sql` to ensure all product images use the correct paths:

- Images should be served from `/assets/products/...`
- Not from `/src/assets/...` (which doesn't exist in production)

## How to Apply the Fix

1. **Deploy the code changes** - The updated OptimizedImage and ProductCard components
2. **Run the SQL script** in Supabase:
   ```sql
   -- Copy contents of scripts/fix-production-images.sql
   -- Run in Supabase SQL editor
   ```

## Verification

After deployment:

1. Clear browser cache
2. Check that images load on:
   - Homepage product grid
   - Category pages
   - Product detail pages
3. Check browser console for any image loading errors

## Prevention

1. Always use paths relative to the public directory for production assets
2. Test lazy loading implementations thoroughly in production environment
3. Consider using priority loading for above-the-fold images
