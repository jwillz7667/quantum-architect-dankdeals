## What Remains Active

- Product browsing and search
- Order placement and tracking
- User profile management
- All public pages (FAQ, Terms, Privacy, etc.)

## Database

The admin-related database tables and migrations remain in place but are inactive since the UI and routes are disabled. This allows for easy re-enabling if needed in the future.
